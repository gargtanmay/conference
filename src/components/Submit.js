            2. The language of the Publication is English. The mode of presentation should be in third person.
            <br />
            3. SI units should be used wherever applicable. Other units, if used, should be given only in parentheses preceded by SI units.
            <br />
            4. Mathematical symbols should be typed and care should be taken to differentiate between similar characters (e.g. 1 and I), upper and lower case letters and superscripts and subscripts.
            <br />
            5. Lengthy mathematical proofs and derivations and extensive test data should be given as an appendix.
